This section introduces the proposed steps to convert depth images to feature images.
Depth images are affected by different error sources and intrinsic noise of the sensory system.
The novel feature image are sensitive to these errors and edge-preserving filtering, covered first, mitigates their effects.
Following this, multiple conversion strategies are shown that transform depth data to feature images.
Additional remarks on their implementation are provided.
The four selected feature detectors, \acrshort{sift}, \acrshort{surf}, \acrshort{orb} and \acrshort{akaze}, and their design is explained subsequently, covering all processing steps from the raw depth images to extracted features.
