As a different analytical approach to producing feature images the calculation of the \gls{curvature} for each depth value.
The two common measures of curvature in differential geometry are \gls{gaussian-curvature} and \gls{mean-curvature}\cite{Kuhnel2008}.

If the function is known as a graph the \Gls{gaussian-curvature} can be estimated using the derivatives of the function.
For depth data each depth value is a sample of this function graph and numeric approximation of the derivatives allows the calculation of the curvature.
\begin{align}
    \mathfrak{K} &= \frac{f_{uu} f_{vv} - f_{uv}^2}{{(1 + f_u^2 + f_v^2)}^2}
\end{align}
With
\begin{align*}
    f_{x} &= \frac{y_1 - y_0}{\Delta x} \\
    f_{xx} &= \frac{y_1 + y_{-1} - 2 y_0}{{\Delta x}^2}
\end{align*}
as approximation for the derivatives.

Similarly, the \Gls{mean-curvature} can be calculated with a different formula.
\begin{align}
    \mathfrak{H} &= \frac{{(1 + f_{v}^2)} f_{uu} - 2 f_u f_v f_{uv} + {(1 + f_u^2)} f_{vv}}{2 \sqrt{1 + f_u^2 + f_v^2}^3}
\end{align}
Both measures of curvature are $\mathfrak{K},\mathfrak{H} \in {\rm I\!R}$.
To convert them into a meaningful grayscale image they need to be clamped to arbitrary bounds, that can be choosen based on visual distinctiveness or other heuristics.
After clamping the values are scaled and quantized accordingly.
