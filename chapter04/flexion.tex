\subsubsection{\Glspl{flexion-image}}\label{flexion-image-section}

Each pixel of a \Gls{flexion-image} is the dot-product of the local normal
calculated from horizontal and vertical neighbouring pixel with the
normal calculated with the diagonal neighbours.
Figure~\ref{fig:flexion-image-scetched} demonstrates the disparity of both normals for an arbitrary surface patch.
The normal calculated from the diagonal and vertical neighbouring vertices are drawn in blue and the normal calculated with the diagonals red.
Both normal-vectors are drawn with their origin in the central depth value.

The flexion $f$ is defined as
\begin{align}
    f &= \abs{n_1 \cdotp n_2}
\end{align}
Because $n_1$ and $n_2$ are of length $1$ the value of $f$ is in the range $[0, 1]$ and gets scaled accordingly.

The smaller the dot-product gets, the higher is the local flexion of the
surface. This local property of the geometry then results in visual
features detectable with classical feature detectors and descriptors like
\Gls{sift} or \Gls{surf}.
