\subsection{Feature Detection and Description}
\label{sec:feature_algorithms}

The final processing step of the range data is the feature detection on the converted images.
This thesis analyzes multiple state-of-the-art algorithms well established in the computer vision community.
Although each keypoint detector and descriptor is designed with gray-scale images in mind, they are optimized for classical camera images that provide more texture than the converted feature images.
Key to all algorithms is the search for salient regions in the image that can be consistently detected from different viewpoints and changing environmental conditions.
Evaluating the performance of each algorithm is the key task in the evaluation of the conversion approach.
