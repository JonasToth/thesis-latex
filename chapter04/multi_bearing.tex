\subsubsection{Multi-Directional Bearing Angle}

The Multi-Directional \gls{bearing-angle-image} attempts to overcome the limitation of missing rotation invariance for the classical \gls{bearing-angle-image}.
Instead of calculation just one angle in one direction the two adjacent triangle are analyzed together.
Figure~\ref{fig:max-curve} shows how the triangles are related.
Both angles $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are calculated with equation~\ref{eq:bearing-angle}, for $\gamma$ the values of $d_{i}$ and $d_{i-1}$ just need to be swapped.
\begin{figure}

    \caption[Schematic Representation of the Max-Curve]{The Max-Curve composes two \Glspl{bearing-angle} in vertical, horizontal, diagonal and antidiagonal direction. The maximum angle is then selected as pixel value.}\label{fig:max-curve}
\end{figure}
Both angles are added together, resulting in the angle of an edge at this position.
\begin{equation}
    B = \beta + \gamma
\end{equation}
This calculation is again only in one direction and not rotation invariant but already symmetrical.
The value $B$ can be defined for diagonal, antidiagonal, horizontal and vertical sampling of the image.
The final step for rotation invariance is the reduction of these four values to its maximum.
\begin{align}
    B &= \max{\{B_{diagonal}, B_{antidiagonal}, B_{horizontal}, B_{vertical}\}}
\end{align}
The conversion results in the images in Figure~\ref{fig:max-curve-images} for the same scene and positions as for the \gls{bearing-angle-image}.

\end{figure}
The goal of rotational invariance is achieved, unfortunatly the image lacks texture and contrast.
Qualitative tests with common feature detectors yielded weak keypoint responses.
Therefore, this approach received no further attention.
