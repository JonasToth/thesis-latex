\subsection{Conversion from Depth Image to Feature Image}\label{sec:feature_images}

The conversion of depth images to feature images needs to result in a single scalar value because all keypoint detectors work on a single signal channel.
Every feature image is calculated on range data in floating point format, potentially requiring the preprocessing step presented in Section~\ref{sec:range_depth_conversion}.
The representation change from integer to floating point data does no further processing than simple type conversion.

This section introduces and develops multiple potential feature images that were considered during this thesis.
Conversions for images of the \emph{Synthetic} scene (Section~\ref{sec:dataset_synthetic}) containing different primitive geometric structures serve as examples for the visual appeal of each feature image type.
