\subsection{Conversion from Depth Image to Feature Image}\label{sec:feature_images}

To transition from a depth-based to a feature-based registration, a prior conversion from depth values to some derived \emph{feature image} is required.
This conversion needs to result in a single scalar value because all keypoint detectors work on a single signal channel.
Every feature image is calculated on range data in floating point format, potentially requiring the preprocessing step presented in Section~\ref{sec:range_depth_conversion}.
The representation change from integer to floating point data does no further processing than simple type conversion.

This section introduces and develops multiple potential feature images that were considered during this thesis.
Not all of them are sufficient for the intended use case.
The examplaric conversion show the \emph{Synthetic} scene (described in Section~\ref{sec:dataset_synthetic}) with different primitive geometric structures but no impurities other than 16\,bit range data as input.
