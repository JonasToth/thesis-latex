\subsection{Conversion from Depth-Image to Feature Image}

For transition from depth-based to feature-based registration a prior conversion from depth values to a derived image is required.
This conversion needs to result in a single scalar value because all keypoint detectors work on a single color channel.
The converted images are coined feature image alltogether, because they form the starting point for the classical feature based keypoint matching and image alignment.
Every feature image is calculated on range data in floating point format, requiring the potential preprocessing step presented in Section~\ref{sec:range_depth_conversion}.
Conversion from integer data does no further processing than simple type conversion.

This section introduces and develops multiple potential feature images that were considered during this thesis.
Not all of them are sufficient for the intended use case.
The examplaric conversion show a synthetic scene with different primitive geometric structures but no impurities other then 16bit range data as input.
