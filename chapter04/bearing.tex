Scaramuzza et.al\cite{Scaramuzza2007} proposes \Glspl{bearing-angle-image} were each pixel is the angle between the current point, the optical center and the previous point.
Lin et.al\cite{Lin2017} use \Glspl{bearing-angle-image} to automatically align pointclouds using keypoints extracted with \acrshort{surf}.
Figure~\ref{fig:bearing_angle} shows the triangle that these three points form.
The neighbourhood relationship can be choosen arbitrarily resulting in four \Glspl{bearing-angle-image}, horizontal, vertical, diagonal and antidiagonal.
The second variable is the direction the angle is calculted, e.g.~for horizontal images it can be calculated from left-to-right or right-to-left.
This does not exhibit new information, because the angle of the other direction is immediatly known from the fact that the sum of the angles is $180\degree$.
Nontheless, the direction must be defined to obtain stable visual features.

The formula for the \gls{bearing-angle} $\beta$ is derived with the cosine theorem.
For the horizontal left-to-right calculation the formula is as follows.
\begin{equation}
    \beta = \arccos%
            \frac{d_{i,j} - d_{i-1,j} \cos \Delta\varphi}%
                 {\sqrt{d_{i,j}^2 + d_{i-1,j}^2 - 2 d_{i,j} d_{i-1,j} \cos \Delta\varphi}}
\end{equation}
Note that both Scaramuzza\cite{Scaramuzza2007} and Lin\cite{Lin2017} have typos in the formulae they provided.
A full derivation for the correct equation is provided in Appendix~\ref{sec:bearing_derivation}.

The angular resolution $d\varphi$ between two pixels of the depth image depends on the camera model in use.
The pinhole models angular resolution changes between pixel pairs, equirectangular image have a constant resolution between pixels.
In general, the angle $d\varphi$ can be calculated with the spherical coordinates $P_{\mathcal{S},1}, P_{\mathcal{S},2}$ of the pixel pair $p_1, p_2$.
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    \abs{\vec{P_{\mathcal{S},1}}} &= \abs{\vec{P_{\mathcal{S},2}}} = 1 \implies P_{\mathcal{S},1} \cdot P_{\mathcal{S},2} = \cos d\varphi \\
    d\varphi &= \arccos P_{\mathcal{S},1} \cdot P_{\mathcal{S},2}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The \Gls{bearing-angle} is in the range $\beta \in (0, \pi)~rad$.
Linear scaling of the angle to the color depth of the target image results in a grayscale image suitable for feature extraction.
A general scaling function for an \emph{unsigned 8bit} image and arbitrary angle range follows here.
This formulation can be used for different color depths and other potential angle calculations that result in different boundary conditions.
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    \beta_{min} &= 0 ~& c_{min} &= 0 \\
    \beta_{max} &= \pi ~& c_{max} &= 255 \\
    \beta_{scaled} &= \floor*{c_{min} + \beta \frac{c_{max} - c_{min}}{\beta_{max} - \beta_{min}}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

This property limits its applicability for automatic registration of bigger discontinues changes of the camera pose.
