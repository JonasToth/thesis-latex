\subsection{Depth Image Impainting}

Filling holes in the depth image can be done with depth image impainting techniques.

\begin{itemize}
    \item interpolation between neighbouring pixels
    \item using the color image to find edges
    \item estimation of planes or other geometric primitives and filling the depth values to match those primitives
\end{itemize}

Those techniques have different level of quality.
Manual testing for the scenes presented later showed no noticeable improvement.
This is due to the walls inside the mine have many sharp edges that do not follow normal manbuild structures.
Impainting-techniques work better when planes and bigger surfaces can be used to estimate the real world geometry, which is not the case for the experiments.
