\subsection{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item multiple sensors per robot resulting in multimodal sensor fusion requirements
    \item depth sensors increasingly used in the field and quality of sensors improve dramatically
    \item performance/compute costs of ICP high
    \item other approaches require many compuations as well, parallelization is major concern for improving performance
    \item due to ICP limitations, combining laserscan and depth sensor hard
    \item ICP requires correspondent in the pointclouds and inital pose
    \item global positioning not easily done, because of local maxima and computational cost of for example particle based approaches
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problem Definition}

\begin{itemize}
    \item rigid and non-rigid registration
    \item registering depth and range data
    \item Kinect fusion
    \item dependent on initial pose
    \item some algorithms for laserscan matching work on 2D laser scans, but not dense 3D scans
    \item other multi-modal registrations
    \item mining environment
    \item prior high resolution laser scans exist
    \item bad lighting conditions
\end{itemize}
