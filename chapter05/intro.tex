The experiments evaluate the performance the \gls{bearing-angle} and \gls{flexion-image} for a variety of sensors, datasets and processing setups.
They demonstrate both success and failure under certain circumstances.
Both qualitative and quantitative are considered in the evaluation.
Section~\ref{sec:results} discusses these results.
