The experiments to evaluate the performance of \gls{bearing-angle} and \glspl{flexion-image} span a variety of sensors, datasets and processing setups.
First, the metrics to determine if a feature algorithm produces utilisable results are explained.
Then, the applied settings of the algorithms and evaluation datasets are presented.
