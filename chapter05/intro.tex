The experiments evaluate the performance of the \gls{bearing-angle} and \glspl{flexion-image} for a variety of sensors, datasets and processing setups.
They demonstrate both success and failure under certain circumstances.
Both qualitative and quantitative aspects are considered in the evaluation.
Section~\ref{sec:results} presents and discusses these results.
