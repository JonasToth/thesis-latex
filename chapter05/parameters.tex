\subsection{Parameter Search}

During the evaluation process each algorithm was first tested in its default configuration and different kinds of keypoint filters.
Inspecting and comparing the results already showed some spread in the performance metrics.
Some more variations in algorithm parameters were conducted and included in the evaluation, to check what changes might have further impact and if there are substantial changes to the results.
This iterative process is not directly visible in the graphs and will not be mentioned further, but algorithm configurations with multiple parameters changed are an outcome of additional experimentation with the system.
