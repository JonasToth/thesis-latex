\subsection{Parameter Search}

As first step the unfiltered depth images are used for the conversions.
The keypoint count, distribution, response and size are analyzed as baseline.
Filtering keypoints by response and size as test to improve the performance as second step that is compared.
Third steps is to experiment with the same settings but different kinds of filtering to see if there is performance improvement from smoother surfaces.

Inspecting and comparing the results already showed some spread in the performance metrics.
Some more variations in algorithm parameters were conducted and included in the evaluation, to check what changes might have further impact and if there are substantial changes to the results.
This iterative process is not directly visible in the graphs and will not be mentioned further, but algorithm configurations with multiple parameters changed are an outcome of additional experimentation with the system.
