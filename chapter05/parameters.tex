\subsection{Parameter Search}

Using the established methods to compare algorithms and configurations the most promising algorithms are tweaked slightly to check, if different parameters show better results.

\subsection{Optimized Parameters}

The optimized parameters are used for another round of evaluation, yielding more results for the following datasets.
