First, the evaluation of the keypoint detector and descriptors is presented for \acrshort{sift}, \acrshort{surf}, \acrshort{orb} and \acrshort{akaze} with the focus on central results.
The out-of-the-box performance of each algorithm is compared with multiple custom processing configurations.
After a short conclusion of the feature performance \acrshort{sift} and \acrshort{akaze} are selected to compute a visual odometry on an unseen benchmark dataset.
Subsequently, the results are discussed.
