    \caption[Keypoint and matching results for \texttt{\acrshort{sift}/raw/default}]{\emph{Keypoint and matching results for \texttt{\acrshort{sift}/raw/default}.} The \gls{flexion-image} results in more detected keypoints for all datasets and hence more correspondences. The recall of \acrshort{sift} is outstanding and above 80\% for even the demanding \emph{Mine} dataset.}\label{tab:sift_data}
\end{table}
The number of detected keypoints is significantly higher for the \glspl{flexion-image} compared to the \glspl{bearing-angle-image} in each dataset (Table~\ref{tab:sift_data}).
Approximately twice as many correspondences between keypoints are detected for \glspl{flexion-image}.
The distribution of the keypoints in each dataset indicates no obvious problems in any regard (Figure~\ref{fig:sift_kp_distribution}).
In \emph{Mine}, the keypoints are not as common in the ground area but denser on the walls.
This is expected, as those have the most surface structure.
Similarly in \emph{Synthetic}, the rotation of the camera shows a clear trace in the keypoint distribution, demonstrating that they stick to geometrically salient regions.
Neither the keypoint sizes, responses or location distribution show surprising characteristics and their distributions are plotted in Appendix~\ref{sec:sift_stats}.

The most relevant criterion for matching performance is the descriptors capability to differentiate between regions.
For each dataset, except \emph{Synthetic}, the distribution of the descriptor distance of matches shows that true positives and false positives result in a different distribution (Figure~\ref{fig:sift_descriptor_distance}).
Each curve is normalized with the total number of true and false positives per dataset for comparison.
Defining a maximum matching distance threshold would result in less false positives for both conversion types.
The overlapping curves for \emph{Synthetic} are an artifact of the inherent similarity of different regions and can not be avoided.
Appendix~\ref{sec:backprojection_sift} contains plots visualizing the matching performance in each dataset in the actual images.

\caption[\acrshort{sift} descriptors distances]{\emph{\acrshort{sift} descriptors distances.} The distributions of descriptor distances show a clear relationship between the distance and the likelihood of a true or false positive. This insight justifies a maximum matching distance to separate false positives better from true positives.}\label{fig:sift_descriptor_distance}
\end{figure}
In terms of the \acrshort{ROC} analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:roc_sift}) the \gls{flexion-image} shows a slightly better performance, but no clear advantage can be established from the plot.
Additional parameter variation in the \acrshort{sift} algorithm and filtering setup varies the true positive rate by only $5\%$ and the false positive rate by even less.

The differences between the datasets are inherent to their quality and setup.
Most notably, \acrshort{sift} has a very high true positive rate (recall) showing its descriptive power and potential for object recognition tasks.
The very similar false positive rate in all datasets points to inherent similarities in the geometries of the scenes that might be explained by the lack of textures as differentiating factor.

Both feature image conversions demonstrate that the salient geometric regions can be recognized with \acrshort{sift}.
The \gls{flexion-image} produces more keypoints and correspondences compared to the \gls{bearing-angle-image}.
Additionally, the true positive rate in \emph{Mine} is slightly higher in this challenging dataset.
From these findings the author concludes that the \gls{flexion-image} performs better.
The theoretical aspects, like rotation invariance and the inclusion of more information per pixel, are additional arguments to prefer the \gls{flexion-image}.
