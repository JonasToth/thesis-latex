    \caption[Keypoint and matching results for \texttt{\acrshort{orb}/raw/default}]{\emph{Keypoint and matching results for \texttt{\acrshort{orb}/raw/default}.} The high number of false negatives and the low Youden index are an indicator for problems of the algorithm. The amount of additional keypoints for \glspl{flexion-image} is lower than for \acrshort{sift}.}
\end{table}
\acrshort{orb}'s detector finds less keypoints than \acrshort{sift} for both \glspl{flexion-image} and \glspl{bearing-angle-image}.
But their size, response and location distribution (Appendix~\ref{sec:orb_stats}) indicate severe problems.
Keypoints are not detected over multiple scales and the response shows a very inconsistent pattern over the different datasets.
For \emph{Mine}, the keypoints cluster in the middle and the borders of the field-of-view of the depth sensors.
Those regions contains sharp edges from feature image to black because of missing range data.
The \acrshort{fast} keypoint detector characteristics of comparing brightness values at different sampling points is likely to blame for the bad detector performance.
Similar to \acrshort{surf}'s shortcoming, it does not deal well with the smoother gray changes but requires sharp edges.
As \acrshort{orb} employs blurring and scale space, too, the effect of missing contrast between sampling points worsens in higher levels of the pyramid, yielding no keypoints there.

\caption[\acrshort{orb} descriptor distances]{\emph{\acrshort{orb} descriptor distances.} The results show a slight separation of true from false positives. The binary descriptor compares brightness values on specific sampling points. This mechanism is different from \acrshort{sift} or \acrshort{surf} and seemingly not as robust as \acrshort{sift}.}\label{fig:orb_descriptor_distances}

The descriptor distance in Figure~\ref{fig:orb_descriptor_distances} show some separation between true and false positives.
This is better than \acrshort{surf}, but worse than \acrshort{sift}.
The mixed results are reflected in ROC space (Figure~\ref{fig:orb_roc}) by the random performance for \emph{Mine} and OK performance for \emph{Synthetic} and \emph{Office}.
Everything considered, \acrshort{orb} is not suitable for the proposed feature images.
