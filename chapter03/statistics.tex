\subsection{Statistics of Binary Classifiers}

To evaluate the performance of keypoint detection and feature matching such a system can be considered a binary classifier.
The clasification task is to determine if a keypoint X1 of image I1 corresponds with keypoint X2 in image I2 with a true or false outcome.

The evaluation of the performance of various keypoint detection and matching algorithms makes extensive use of this idea.
As with most statistics it is necessary to consider the distribution of a quantity and analyze it from multiple view points.
Therefor the final evaluation will consider other criteria, like keypoint distribution and number of keypoints per frame as well.

\begin{itemize}
    \item error categories, true positive, true negative, false postive and false negative
    \item contingency-table
    \item leading to accuracy (percentage of correct decisions)
    \item this leads to various ratios describing the performance 
    \item common measures precision-recall
    \item common measures sensitivity-specificity
    \item comparibility in \gls{ROC} space
    \item informedness of the system as youden index and correspondence to \gls{ROC} space
    \item degress of freedom in roc space and generally dependence on absolute numbers for decision 
\end{itemize}
