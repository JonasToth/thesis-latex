\subsection{Image Formation and Camera Models}

\subsubsection{Pinhole Camera Model}

Forward projection, backward projection.
Very common, and depth sensor can be modeled with this

\subsubsection{Equirectangular Camera Model}

Image to sphere, forward and backward projection
Laser scan can be modeled with this
Vertical field of view is limited

\subsubsection{Range and Depth Conversion}

There are two possible conventions on how to store depth data.
Depth is the distance from coordinate plane.
Range is the length of the light ray that corresponds to a pixel value.
Depth-Sensors usually provide depth information, LIDAR range information.
For consistency and generality depth data is converted to range data.
This simplifies later conversion and mixing of different camera models.
