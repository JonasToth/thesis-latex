\subsection{Coordinate Systems}

This section introduces the used naming conventions for coordinate systems that model the sensory systems used in computer vision.
Homogeneous coordinates allow efficient computation of affine transformations with one matrix-vector multiplication and knowledge of them is a prerequisite to fully understand the pinhole camera model in Section~\ref{sec:pinhole_model}.
Corke\cite[p. 15-39,533]{corke_2011} provides excellent coverage of these topics.

\subsubsection*{Naming Conventions}

A point in space is referenced by a vector in that space.
The global reference frame is arbitrarily chosen in \emph{world coordinates}.
Within that world coordinate system exist one or more sensors spanning their own coordinate system.
Referencing the point relative to such a sensor yields \emph{camera coordinates}.
The sensor itself performs some form of dimension reducing projection of the three dimensional point to a two dimensional point, an \emph{image coordinate}\cite[p. 251-261]{corke_2011}.
\emph{Image coordinates} are an intermediate representation before discretising the point to individual pixels, called \emph{pixel coordinates}.
Inverting this projection results in \emph{spherical coordinates}, camera coordinates with unit length that just encode the direction of a light ray that hits a pixel.
Different sensor models describe these projecting transformations mathematically.
The relative transformation between \emph{camera coordinates} and \emph{world coordinates}, the sensors \emph{pose}, can change over time.
Multiple sensors can exist within the \emph{world coordinate system}.

\subsubsection*{Coordinate Transformations and Pose}

Let $\mathbf{O_\mathcal{W}}$ be the origin of the \emph{world coordinate system}.
A three dimensional vector $\vec{P_\mathcal{W}} = \rowvecxxx{U}{V}{W}$ represents a point $\mathbf{P_\mathcal{W}}$ in this room relative to the origin $\mathbf{O_\mathcal{W}}$.
Seeing this point $\mathbf{P_\mathcal{W}}$ from a camera $\mathbf{C_\mathcal{W}}$ within the same room is equivalent to transforming the coordinate system from \emph{world coordinates} to \emph{camera coordinates} by a change of basis, as demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:coordinate_transformation}.
The relative rotation and translation of the camera $\mathbf{C_\mathcal{W}}$ to the room is also called its \emph{pose}\cite[p.15-39]{corke_2011}.
It is parameterized by a rotation matrix $R$ and a translation vector $\vec{t}$.
Homogeneous coordinates provide a computational more efficient way to apply pose transformations to vectors with a single 4 dimensional matrix-vector multiplication (Equation~\ref{eq:homogeneous_matrix}) instead of a three dimensional matrix-vector multiplication and an additional 3$\times$1 vector addition.
The point $\mathbf{P_\mathcal{W}}$ seen from the camera $\mathbf{C_\mathcal{W}}$ is computed with the homogeneous transformation matrix $H = \begin{bmatrix} R & \vec{t} \\ \begin{matrix}0 & 0 & 0\end{matrix} & 1 \end{bmatrix}$.
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    \colvech{X}{Y}{Z}&= \begin{pmatrix}
        r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_x \\
        r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_y \\
        r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_z \\
        0      & 0      & 0      & 1 \\
    \end{pmatrix} \colvech{U}{V}{W} \\
    \vec{P_\mathcal{C}} &= H \vec{P_\mathcal{W}}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:homogeneous_matrix}
\end{equation}
