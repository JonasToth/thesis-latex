\subsection{Future Work}

The proposed \gls{flexion-image} bridges the gap between pointcloud processing and classical computer vision algorithms.
Common processes, as visual odometry, global localisation with a bag-of-words approach and maybe even optical flow algorithms should be evaluated.
The foundational insights on the descriptor performance of \acrshort{sift} and \acrshort{akaze} help to finetune heuristics, such as the maximum matching distance, for these tasks.

New formulations for visual odometry and relative pose calculation become possible, because the range value for each pixel is available.
This additional information for each image coordinate reduces the required number of true correspondences to reconstruct the relative pose.
Investigating the viability of a new formulation for this problem and potential speed and efficiency gains seems to be the highest value research targets.
The classical \acrshort{icp} formulation relies on establishing explicit correspondences between points, too.
Using the \gls{flexion-image} and classical feature descriptors might result in a new variation of this algorithm.
Both problems are related and need further research.
